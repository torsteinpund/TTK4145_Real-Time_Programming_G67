Triple Elevator Repository in the subject TTK4145 Real-Time programming

## Project Description

This project is part of the TTK4145 Real-Time Programming course at NTNU. The goal of the project is to develop a real-time system to control three elevators operating in a multi-story building. The project includes the implementation of algorithms for elevator control, request distribution, and fault handling. The system is designed to be robust, efficient, and capable of handling concurrent requests from multiple users. 

The project is divided into several modules, including:
- **cost**: Algorithms for cost calculation and request distribution. This is based on one of the functions given in project resources
- **elevio**: Interface for communication with the elevator hardware.
- **fsm**: Finite state machine for elevator control.
- **lights**: Control of elevator lights.
- **master**: Main logic of the system.
- **network**: Network communication between elevators. This is currently only containing the files we were given in the subject project resources 
- **orderHandler**: Handling of elevator requests.
- **requests**: Processing of elevator requests.
- **timer**: Timing and time-related functions.
- **types**: Definitions of data types used in the system.
